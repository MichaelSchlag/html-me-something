            <h1>Mike's Top Animal Picks</h1>
            <p>This is the story of how there were once five dope animals that Mike decided to pick. And so, those animals are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#Elephant">Elephant</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Bat">Bat</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Pangolin">Pangolin</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Orangutan">Orangutan</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Turtle">Turtle</a></li>
            </ul>
        </header>
        <article>
            <div>
                <a name="Elephant"></a>
                <h1>5: Elephant</h1>
                <p>What list is complete without the elephant? Highly intelligent, unique looking, and even friendly. I wanna be pals with an elephant.</p>

            <div>
                <a name="Bat"></a>
                <h1>4: Bat</h1>
                <p>Bats have a bad reputation. But actually, they're very cute! I love the way they squad up in caves and old buildings.</p>

            <div>
                <a name="Pangolin"></a>
                <h1>3: Pangolin</h1>
                <p>These little dudes seem so polite. But alas, they are trafficked for their scales to make fake medicine. I just wish people would leave them alone.</p>

            <div>
                <a name="Orangutan"></a>
                <h1>2: Orangutan</h1>
                <p>I love these floppy fellas. They are very funny, especially when they swing from trees. They better not go extinct.</p>

            <div>
                <a name="Turtle"></a>
                <h1>1: Turtles</h1>
                <p>Since early childhood, turtles have been my #1 pick. Why? Maybe their badass attitude, their unique shell, their beak, or their color. Honestly their only fault is how they smell.</p>
